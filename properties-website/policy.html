          a.) Information You Submit To Us. We do not collect any personally
          identifiable information from you unless you register under a HAR.com
          account or with a Realtor®/licensee. If you sign up for any HAR.com

          administer our site. When a web browser or email application requests
          a web page or email from another device on the Internet, it
          automatically gives that device the address where it should send the
          information. This is called the computer’s “IP address”. This
          “address” does not contain any personally identifiable information.
