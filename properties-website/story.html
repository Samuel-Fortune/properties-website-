              I was born and raised in Beijing. I immigrated to Houston in 1991.
              I graduated from Conrad N. Hilton College of Global Hospitality
              Leadership of University of Houston. I had always been working on
              the restaurant’s side of the business as a student, so naturally,
              I was offered a “restaurant’s manager” job after I graduated. It
              was different running a restaurant in the real-world compared to
              working at our “magic-kingdom-like” Hilton College. Instead of
              setting a goal to climb up the managerial ladder, I was only
              frizzled by the daily operational stress. Being exhausted, I sank
              into a phrase of “lost,” not sure who I was, what I was doing and
              why I was there. I was up for a change. I went back to Hilton
              College to take some graduate courses. I thought the idea of
              pursuing a master’s degree may elevate me. But it didn’t. I was
              bored after finishing a few initial courses. I felt like drifting
              trough a dark tunnel. Until eventually, one day, some friends
              talked me into selling real estate. Real estate, it sounded so
              new, yet I felt invigorated. I saw a light at the end of the
              tunnel.

            >
              Without much hesitation, I had dived into it without any
              experience, knowledge nor clienteles. Yet my heart was full, full
              of hope and determination. Obtained my licenses in August 2002, I
              joined RE/MAX and started my career as a REALTOR. In the following
              16 years, I grew with the Metro team, personally and
              professionally. Rain, or shine, I had never thought of changing
              brokerage. I stayed where I was. During those years, I rose,
              failed, and rose again. I earned countless awards, Top Producer,
              RE/MAX 20/20, Hall of Fame…along with the ups and downs in life,
              market fluctuation, and all the hurricanes we survived.

            In 2014, I joined the Women’s Council of REALTORs Houston network. I
            served on board and started as VP of Membership. In 2016, I was
            honored to be the President of the Women’s Council Houston network.
            I served with passion and learned with heart. Serving the network
            helped me to root deeply in our industry. I was enlightened, in a
            sense of becoming aware of who I was, where I was and what I was
            doing. I gained a deeper and better understanding of what it meant
            to be Me as a REALTOR. I was no longer lost. I found myself. Through
            building strong relationships, I was bonded with our business,
            industry, and communities. “JWang on the block” was on the horizon.

            By that time, we had already lived in the social media platform era
            for some years. Since Facebook was launched in 2004, many other
            popular apps were up hastily like popcorns. Though some called it
            “disruption,” I called it “revolution.” We evolved into a new way of
            communication and marketing. Serving the Women’s Council, we fully
            utilized social media to connect members, create educational
            programs and networking events. I was doing a lot of photos and
            video clips then, sort of the “president” accidentally turned into a
            “photographer.” Nonetheless, the more I did it, the more I felt a
            “need,” a “need” for a professional media presentation that can
            truly reflect us, our image, and our voice. So, I thought, what if I
            build a video production?

            In February of 2018, I founded JWang Media, a production to promote
            and market our real estate professionals through “story telling”
            type of custom videos. Whether it’s about a REALTOR’s profile, a
            lender’s insight, a title company’s statement, a networking event,
            or a property highlight, every quick video presents a theme, a
            personality, and an expertise. Since then, we’ve created, crafted,
            and produced many videos to blast out via social media platforms.
            Not only the listings gained more “limelight” but also the
            professionals gained the “stardom.” In result, we received more than
            hundreds of thousands of viewers. The audience liked and
            complimented the true voices and authentic messages. It’s been a
            popular marketing approach that delivered both value and joy.

            A few months later in the same year, in November 2018, I obtained my
            broker license. I established JWang Properties, a Boutique realty
            with personal touch. I declared that “through our innovative system
            and custom video production, JWang Properties advances REALTORs to
            be the Superstars to serve our clients, industry, and communities.
            We offer one stop customized strategies and service plans tailored
            to each client’s individual needs in both residential and commercial
            real estate.” You can imagine, however, holding my broker license
            and looking around, it was only me, a broker/ agent of JWang
            Properties. Yet that didn’t bother me. I planned a Grand Open Party
            to draw the curtain of a new phrase. It was a perfect time to
            celebrate and thank the support from friends, colleagues, industry,
            and communities.

          >
            Today, less than four years later, we have top producers and expert
            agents in both residential and commercial fields. Together we bring
            value to our clients and strive for multi-million and more sales
            volumes. Value, no doubt, is what we produce and deliver. Yet we
            offer more. We offer joy. I believe many REALTORs out there can
            relate, that when it comes to representing our clients, their
            problems become our problems and their happiness become our
            happiness. We get on this journey together, sharing the experiences
            and building the memories. As REALTORs, we are the hub and personal
            touch in every transaction. Even when we fail to close the deal
            sometimes, we let our relationships prevail. This is how we define
            us, a JWang team.

            In July 2019, I started to draft my debut, a novel, “Girl Wears
            Those Shoes.” Writing has always been a great part of me and
            finally, I decided to put it into a perspective. I’ve been a fiction
            lover, so I wanted to venture into that. There was no doubt that
            “creating a fiction” was the toughest project I had carried on. I
            wanted to portrait characters that can inspire young professionals
            in the business. I wanted to share the ideas, experiences, answers,
            values, and even controversial issues in a young REALTOR’s life.

            The story came together towards the end of summer of 2021. The
            protagonist of the story, Gigi O, represents a new model of Chinese
            immigrants of our time. Through her personal and professional
            growth, the spirit, principle, and value are universal. The battle,
            discipline, and the strength it takes to run through the course are
            the same for everybody, regardless of any race, sex, or ethnic
            background. The triumph, like the Red Sole, does not prejudice. It
            loves the woman who rocks it!

            On December 14, 2021, “Girl Wears Those Shoes” was officially
            released. I had a Holliday launch celebration party prior to that.
            I’m grateful for receiving much positive feedback. “It’s a fun
            read!” “I’ve never known it takes that much to be working as a
            REALTOR!” “I’ve learned a lot about real estate!” ….. I’ve always
            told people that my approach to the book is: “If you want to learn,
            you learn. If you don’t want to learn, at least you will be
            entertained!” The joy is what we love to bring and share! We love
            what we do. It’s a journey. Why not make it fun?!

            In January 2022, we officially launched our new website:

            This new site contains three landing parts: “JWang Properties”,
            “JWang Media” & “Girl Wears Those Shoes”. The book page leads to:
